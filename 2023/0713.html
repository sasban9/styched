        Dear Investors,<br>

        Sending a compact update this time. Will send a more detailed update next month. <br>

        <h3>COMPANY ONE LINER:</h3> We are Styched, a global D2C brand, and we make fashion affordable by creating new and evolving styles every week at a quarter of the price compared to any other brand owing to our patented Production On Demand tech and Zero inventory Zero warehouse model

        <h3>ACHIEVEMENTS/LESSONS LEARNED</h3>

        1. <b>Second Acquisition</b> - After acquiring Flatheads, we are now working on the acquisition of <b>Zymrat</b> - a D2C brand focussing on Athleisure, with advanced features like fast wicking, anti odour, anti-static, blended into the fabric. We plan to complete the acquisition in the next 2 weeks. This will also be an  acqui-hire for us, with Ujjawal, the founder of Zymrat joining us full time along with a few team members. This will help us foray deeper into the athleisure and workout segments. <br><br>

        2. <b>Myntra</b> - We are live with Myntra and clocking <u><b>600+ orders per day</b></u> from Myntra already within 2 weeks of launch. And these are all organic orders. Promotions by Myntra will start in August.<br><br>

        3. <b>Footwear Assembly line</b> - In order to be on demand for our footwear segment, we are setting up the complete footwear assembly line in house. Our team visited multiple vendors over the last 2 weeks and we have been able to finalise on the machines and the setup needed. Installation will start next week.<br><br>

        4. <b>Hiring</b> - We have been able to fill quite a few important positions over the last 2 months. In the last one month alone we have been able to onboard 18 new members in the Styched family. We have another 12 positions left open.<br><br>

        5. <b>Award:</b> Best Startup to use technology to enhance Customer Experience (Ecommerce)<br><br>


        <h3>THANK YOUS</h3>
        ● We thank Ujjawal Asthana for introducing us to Startify in Dubai. <br>
        ● We thank Team Flatheads for the wonderful and detailed Knowledge Transfer session on Footwear manufacturing.
        <br><br>

        <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>

        ● UAE Ops - We are delayed by almost a month on our UAE restart. Delay is primarily because of Documentation and Attestation in Singapore. Revised relaunch date - August 1st week. Hiring almost complete for UAE. <br><br>

        <h3>HELP NEEDED</h3>

        ● B2B / Bulk Orders - Kindly refer any B2B or Bulk orders for apparel or merchandise. <br>
        ● Introductions to different non compete brands or banks for Coupon based alliances.<br><br>
