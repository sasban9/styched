        <h3>COMPANY ONE LINER:</h3>   We are Styched, a global D2C brand, and we make fashion affordable by creating new and evolving styles every week at a quarter of the price compared to any other brand owing to our patented Production On Demand tech and Zero inventory Zero warehouse model

<h3>ACHIEVEMENTS/LESSONS LEARNED</h3>

1. Do you remember the Shark Tank India Season 2 Episode on Flatheads which created a massive uproar in social media? Ganesh (CEO of Flatheads) became a Linkedin influencer and the stock sold out in 24 hours. <br><br>

<div class="col-12 text-center"><img src="../newsletters/230414/1.jpg" alt=""></div>

We at Styched, have been planning our Footwear range since last year, and we realised massive potential in terms of technical know-how and market/ business potential that Flatheads has. So, we are now on our way for the first Styched acquisition. We have finalised on the acquisition structure, the LOI has been signed and we should be taking over Flatheads over the next 2-3 weeks. With that, Flatheads will become our Semi Premium sneaker brand, while we will continue the affordable segment within Styched. <br><br>

2. We have received a 17.5 Cr INR termsheet from HT Media for Ad inventory - equity swap, over the next 4 years. While we work on our brand video and photoshoot, this might help us double down on ATL/BTL, print media and offline branding. <br><br>

3. Zero Wastage - We have started using the leftover fabric pieces to make packaging thus moving to a completely Zero wastage business. <br><br>
