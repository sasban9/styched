        <h2>COMPANY ONE LINER:</h2>   We are Styched, a global D2C brand, and we make fashion affordable by creating new and evolving styles every week at a quarter of the price compared to any other brand owing to our patented Production On Demand tech and Zero inventory Zero warehouse model.
        <hr>

<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS/LESSONS LEARNED</h2>

1. <b>Zymrat Acquisition</b> - We completed Zymrat acquisition last week. Currently, we are working towards liquidating the left over inventory before we launch new products and styles. <br><br>

2. <b>Flatheads Pre-Ordering</b> - We are planning to start Pre-Ordering of Flatheads 2.0 on 20th October, and start shipping from 1 November 2023. For Flatheads, we are starting a semi on-demand model, with inventory on Soles and Uppers. Printing and Assembly will happen on demand. <br><br>

3. <b>Myntra relaunch</b> - We worked on a more viable commercial model with the Myntra team so that we can get to profitability faster. We would now work on a 4% commission model instead of the earlier 14% commission model. <br><br>

4. <b>Styched PLUS</b> - We are launching Styched Plus in UAE, which is a semi premium, bespoke yet affordable brand with more customisation options in every apparel. Styles would be priced between 90 AED to 399 AED. <br><br>

5. <b>Acquisitions</b> - We are evaluating the acquisition of EShakti.com, a zero inventory customised apparel brand with large market penetration in the USA. We are working with SOSV and mentors to create a workable model. <br><br>

6. <b>First Franchisee Hub</b> in Tiruppur going live on 1st October. Capacity of ~100 orders per day initially. <br><br>

7. <b>Event</b> - We would be present in the Fashion Tech Week 2023 on 5th October. I am a speaker at one of the panel discussions. The session "On-Demand Manufacturing and India: Feasibility and Opportunities" will take place on 5th October post lunch. <br><br>
